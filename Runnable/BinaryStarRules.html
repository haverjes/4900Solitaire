	<p>Objective<p>
	<p style = "margin-left: 40px">
		Move all cards to one of the two foundation piles at the top of the game board.  Cards can be moved onto a foundation
		if and only if the moved card has a value one less or one greater than the card on the top of the foundation. It doesnt matter 
		how many cards are in each foundation.  As long as all the cards are in either of the foundations, you win!

	<p style = "margin-left: 40px">
		There are two foundation piles in the top center of the screen. An ace is placed on the first foundation and a king on the second.
		The 17 tableaus beneath them contain 6 cards each, for a total of 102 cards.
